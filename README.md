# Blockchain Smart Contract Project

This README provides detailed instructions on how to use the blockchain smart contract for educational or testing purposes on the Sepolia test network. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have a compatible web browser like Google Chrome or Firefox installed on your computer.

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Install MetaMask

MetaMask is a crypto wallet and gateway to blockchain apps. Install it to interact with the Ethereum blockchain:

1. Visit the [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/download.html).
2. Choose the right version for your browser and install the MetaMask extension.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to create a new wallet. Remember to safely store your recovery phrase.

### Step 2: Configure the Sepolia Test Network

1. Open MetaMask and click on the network selection dropdown at the top.
2. Select "Show/Hide test networks" from the dropdown menu.
3. Enable the toggle for test networks if it's not already enabled.
4. Select "Sepolia Test Network" from the list of available networks.

### Step 3: Acquire Test ETH

To perform transactions on the Sepolia test network, you will need test ETH:

1. Go to the [Ethereum Sepolia Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/).
2. Follow the instructions to connect your MetaMask wallet.
3. Request test ETH, which will be sent to your wallet.

### Step 4: Connect Your Wallet to the Website

To interact with the smart contract:

1. Visit the designated website where the smart contract is hosted.
2. Look for a "Connect Wallet" or similar button on the website.
3. Click the button and authorize the website to access your MetaMask wallet.

### Step 5: Send ETH on the Sepolia Network

To send ETH to another address:

1. Click on the "Send" button in your MetaMask wallet.
2. Enter the recipient's Ethereum address.
3. Specify the amount of ETH you want to send.
4. Confirm the transaction details and click "Send".
5. MetaMask will ask for your confirmation before processing the transaction. Confirm it to proceed.

## Common Issues

- Ensure MetaMask is connected to the Sepolia Test Network.
- Verify you have sufficient test ETH for transaction fees
